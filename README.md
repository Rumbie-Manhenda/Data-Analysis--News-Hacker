## Exploring Hacker News Posts

I started this project with a simple question: **what kind of posts actually spark conversation on Hacker News?** On a platform driven by curiosity, feedback, and shared learning, comments matter more than clicks; they show where real engagement happens.

In this analysis, I focus on two of the most distinctive post types on : **Ask HN** and **Show HN**. Ask HN posts are questions posed directly to the community, inviting opinions, advice, and experience. Show HN posts, on the other hand, are about sharing; projects, products, or ideas creators want feedback on.

I compare these two formats to understand:
- Which type generates more discussion on average  
- Whether the time a post is published influences how much engagement it receives  

To keep the analysis meaningful, I worked with a curated dataset of about 20,000 posts. This data was sampled from a much larger collection after removing submissions with zero comments, ensuring the focus stays on posts that actually prompted interaction.

The goal is not just to analyze numbers, but to uncover patterns behind *why* certain posts invite conversation  and how timing and intent shape community response.

**Questions to be answered:**

1. Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
